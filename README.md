If you would like to read about SGAN and using the SGAN project, get in touch with me and I will add you to a provate repo.

I would encourage using my SGAN project, since it supports GAN, WGAN, GP-WGAN and SGAN in one project with one line setting, and it is about 15% faster than the code you can find in GitHub.

If you are doing image generate job, GP-WGAN would be the best choice. If you are doing stochastic modelling work, I encourage you to try out our SGAN. From what we see, SGAN acheive state-of-the-art in this specific task with improvement of 5 ~ 10 times. Besides, GP-WGAN has 50% probability of failing in this stochastic modelling task. We do not abserve such failures in our SGAN.
